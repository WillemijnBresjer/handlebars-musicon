<!-- BUILDING INTERACTIVE JAVASCRIPT WEBSITES
Musicon
In this project, you will be updating the website of an online musical instruments store, Musicon. You will incorporate your knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Handlebars to make a stylish multi-page interactive website!

Musicon will have three separate web pages: a home page, a store page, and a contacts page. The home and store pages already have most of the HTML and CSS set up. Your job is to make the following changes:

Create a navigation bar using unordered lists, anchor tags, and class attributes.
Style the website using your knowledge of display, positioning, color, and font declarations.
Build out semantic templates using a client-side templating engine: Handlebars.
Display relevant information using JavaScript objects, arrays, and control flow alongside built-in Handlebars iteration and control flow helpers. -->
